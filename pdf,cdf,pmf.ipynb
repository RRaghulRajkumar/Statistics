    "PDF (Probability Density Function), CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function), and PMF (Probability Mass Function) are fundamental concepts in probability theory and statistics that help describe the behavior of random variables, both continuous and discrete. Let's delve into each of these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PDF (Probability Density Function):**\n",
    "The PDF is used to describe the distribution of a continuous random variable. It provides information about the likelihood of the variable taking on specific values within a given range. The PDF is denoted as \\(f(x)\\) and satisfies two properties:\n",
    "   - \\(f(x) \\geq 0\\) for all \\(x\\).\n",
    "   - The integral of \\(f(x)\\) over its entire range equals 1.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Mathematically, for a continuous random variable \\(X\\), the probability that \\(X\\) falls within a specific interval \\([a, b]\\) is given by the integral of the PDF over that interval:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \\[ P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function):**\n",
    "The CDF is a function that gives the cumulative probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value. For both continuous and discrete random variables, the CDF is denoted as \\(F(x)\\). In the continuous case, the CDF is defined as the integral of the PDF up to a particular value \\(x\\):\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[ F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f(t) \\, dt \\]\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In the discrete case, the CDF is the sum of the PMF up to a particular value \\(x\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PMF (Probability Mass Function):**\n",
    "The PMF is used to describe the distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability of the variable taking on a specific value. Mathematically, for a discrete random variable \\(X\\), the PMF is denoted as \\(P(X = x)\\) and satisfies two properties:\n",
    "   - \\(P(X = x) \\geq 0\\) for all \\(x\\).\n",
    "   - The sum of the PMF over all possible values of \\(X\\) equals 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In other words, the PMF tells you the probability that a discrete random variable \\(X\\) takes on a particular value \\(x\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the PDF is used for continuous random variables to describe the probability density, the CDF provides the cumulative probability for both continuous and discrete variables, and the PMF describes the probability distribution of discrete random variables. These concepts are crucial for understanding and analyzing the behavior of random variables in probability theory and statistics."
